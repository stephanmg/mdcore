\hypertarget{index_sec_whatis}{}\section{What is mdcore?}\label{index_sec_whatis}
mdcore is an attempt to construct a general-\/purpose library containing efficient implementations of the core routines required for Molecular Dynamics simulations on shared-\/memory parallel architectures.

These target architectures include

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Multi-\/\-Core Processors, \item The I\-B\-M Cell Broadband Engine, \item C\-U\-D\-A-\/capable Graphics Processing Units.\end{DoxyItemize}
The goal of this project is not to provide yet another fully-\/featured simulation software, but to provide shared-\/memory functionallity that can be easily integrated into existing or future simulation codes.\hypertarget{index_sec_using}{}\section{Using mdcore}\label{index_sec_using}
The directory \char`\"{}mdcore/examples\char`\"{} contains a number of small simulations which offer a useful starting point for experimenting with mdcore and implementing your own simulation.
